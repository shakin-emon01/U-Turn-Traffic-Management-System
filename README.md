#U-Turn: Traffic Management System 🚗🚦
U-Turn is a comprehensive Traffic Management System built in C that leverages advanced data structures, algorithms, and file management techniques. It provides a dynamic solution for traffic control and monitoring, including features for managing traffic signals, incidents, violations, emergency vehicle requests, VIP requests, and more.

This project uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path calculation, has role-based user authentication (for Admin and Police), and incorporates an interactive color-coded command-line interface (CLI) for a better user experience.

🚀 Key Features
1. Real-Time Traffic Management
Traffic Signals Control: Manage and control traffic signals at different intersections.
Traffic Violation Records: Register and manage traffic violations, including adding or removing violations.
Incident Management: Add, remove, and view traffic accidents or incidents.
Emergency Vehicle Handling: Prioritize emergency vehicles by optimizing traffic flow.
2. Shortest Path Calculation (Using Dijkstra's Algorithm)
Shortest Path Between Cities: Calculates the shortest route between cities for better traffic management.
Dynamic City Connections: Add or remove cities and their connections dynamically.
3. User Authentication & Role-Based Access
Admin Login: The admin can control signals, incidents, violations, and manage records.
Police Login: Police can manage emergency requests, traffic violations, accidents, and vehicle registrations.
4. File Management System
Persistent Data: Uses text files to store records of violations, accidents, vehicles, etc.
Dynamic File Handling: Data is read and written dynamically for real-time updates.
5. User Interface with Color-Coding
CLI Interface: Clean, simple, and effective command-line interface.
Color-Coded Alerts: Visual feedback through color-coded messages to enhance readability and UX:
Green: Success messages ✅
Red: Error or alert messages 🚨
Yellow: Informational messages ⚠️
6. Optimized Algorithms and Data Structures
Graph Representation: Cities and roads are represented as a graph structure for optimized pathfinding.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Used to calculate the shortest path for emergency vehicles and regular traffic flow.
🛠 Functionality Overview
🚓 Police Panel
Emergency Request: Handle emergency vehicle requests and control traffic signals.
Report Traffic Violations: Police can register and manage violations.
Issue Traffic Warnings: Issue warnings to drivers violating traffic rules.
VIP Request: Handle VIP requests and prioritize their vehicles.
Report Accident: Add and manage traffic accident reports.
Register Vehicle Info: Register vehicle details for law enforcement and record-keeping.
👨‍💼 Admin Panel
Traffic Status: View real-time traffic conditions at various intersections.
Control Traffic Signals: Admins can manually control traffic signals based on current traffic flow.
Incident Management: Admins can handle incidents like accidents and disruptions.
Traffic Violations Records: Admins can view and manage violation records.
Information Records: Admins can maintain and access information about vehicles and traffic conditions.
Shortest Path: View and calculate the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
⚙️ Optimizations & Design
Efficient Algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm optimizes pathfinding, making the system responsive even with a large dataset of cities and intersections.
Modular Structure: The code is divided into modules, including traffic management, file handling, and user authentication, ensuring maintainability.
Color-Coded UI: The system uses ANSI escape codes for color-coding success, error, and informational messages.
File-Based Data Storage: Uses text files to persist traffic data, violations, accidents, and more for easy retrieval.
